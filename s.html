                When asked to compare trends, just state your observations, do NOT justify it. When you compare, always choose the points where the two trends differ the most.
                <br>
                <a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">Words to describe: rose, fell, fluctuated</a>

                Note that not all <i>discuss</i> questions require an ambiguous conclusion of ‘there are both adv and disadv’. Read the data properly, the conclusion drawn must be sensible. 
                <br><a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">
                Proof: 2013 MJ/21, question 1(d) ‘discuss whether it is likely that china will be able to maintain domination of the international REE markets in a time of rising global prices for REE.’ It draws a conclusion of <i>unlikely</i> in a discuss question. Meaning in this case, it is quite hard for the examiners to credit for likely arguments.

                *Towards later years, the papers tend to ask us to evaluate which alternative is better, so remember to have a solid conclusion* <a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">Proof: 2017 ON/23

                When there is an economic action described in the question (asked to evaluate it), always define/explain the action first before going into the adv/disadv. 
                <br><a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">E.g., desirability of fixed exchange rates, current account surplus, expenditure-switching policy, monetary policy, a mixed economy, etc.

            <li class="line">
                On a safety note, when there is an economic term in the question, explain it first too before addressing the question. (apparently, some questions require it and some do not, hence the <i>on a safety note</i>)
                <a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">E.g., Explain how xx will affect consumer surplus. Ans: consumer surplus is the difference between the price the consumer is willing to pay and the market price. (then enter content) 
                <br>Or<br>
                Explain which category of spending has the largest impact on real income. Ans: real income is money income adjusted for price changes. It expresses how many goods and services that a given money income can buy. (then enter content)

                When asked to justify a scenario using an economic theory, classify it first.<br>

                Using price elasticity of demand, explain the effect of increase in price of good A to the producer’s revenue. Ans: good A has inelastic PED. (before going to your answer)
                <br>Or<br>
                Discuss to the extent which gold is like other consumer goods. Ans: (first state gold has a normal supply and demand curve).

            <li class="line">
                When asked to explain the cause of inflation, (you can first classify inflation into cost push and demand pull) always link it to AD (C+I+G+X-M). Describe how each component will be affected. 
                *mention the effectiveness is dependent on how sensitive is each component to the change in ~*

                If the question mentioned the scenario of a boom/recession (asked to explain the effects on smtg), always start with and increase/decrease in general income level.

                Be generous with calculations when asked to <i>show</i> an observation. <br>

                Be generous with the word <i>opportunity cost</i>, especially when they ask you to explain/discuss a choice made by household, government and firms.

                When asked <i>to what extent</i> is A similar to B or is A better than B, remember to state clearly the extent, not just discuss. 
                <br><a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">E.g., to what extent is protectionism more preferable than free trade, state: when the country is experiencing transition economy, when the country has to protect sunrise industries, when the countries want to prevent dumping etc. 
                <br>Or<br>
                To what extent is a current account deficit beneficial for country X, state: to the extent that it is experiencing a developing economy, to the extent that it imports capital goods to increase future production capacity, to the extent when it is short term, etc.

            <li class="line">
                When the question is ambiguous, it is best to tackle both directions.<br>

                When asked to <i>analyse</i> an impact, always remember to conclude if it is beneficial or detrimental

                Questions about using a PPC curve to show trade off or opp cost would be best tackled by plotting two points of the curve showing a movement along the curve, and the quantity forgone.
                <br><a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">E.g., use a PPC to illustrate the opportunity cost between production of biofuels and fossil fuels.

                When asked about how something may contribute to the balance of payments, remember to specify which account and which component.

                When the question mentions anything about specialisation, always answer using the law of comparative advantage. Keywords are: comparative advantage, opportunity cost, factor endowment.
                <br><a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">E.g., discuss the view that nepal should specialise in the production of coffee and columbia should specialise in some other product.

                Questions about how a price/exchange rate is determined in a free market shouldn’t <i>only</i> be answered with ‘supply and demand’. Instead, identify a source of supply/demand, or show a shift in D or S and demonstrate the new equilibrium.
                <br><a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">E.g., explain how the forex value of currency is determined in a free market.

            <li class="line">
                A slick way to elaborate your points on appreciating/depreciating currency: first mention the impact on consumers (price of goods and service) then proceed to producers (price of capital and raw material) instead of just mentioning price of goods.
                <br><a style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);">E.g., do you agree with the view that an appreciating currency is of overall benefit to China?</a>

                When discussing maximum and minimum prices, remember to always draw a diagram and use the point about black market, provided the government did not manage the shortage/surplus.

                A nice phrase to use to describe the aim of <i>dumping</i> - undercut rivals with low prices in the short term, and prices will be increased in the long run.
